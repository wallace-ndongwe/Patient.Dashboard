Projects cover the backend only and also test the controller by mocking the data from the repo. 

I would have preferred to write the tests as functional tests that actually call the endpoints if i had more time. 
I was hampered by lack of a startup class, which made this more challenging and i reverted to unit tests, which are not
as useful.

I used the csvhelper library to parse data from csv into objects. With more time would have moved the csv files into a
separate data project where the parsing would be done, like an ORM. I would have also split out the csvhelper map
classes into separate files and made the maps configurable, as well as the file names.

Would have placed code under src file in github
